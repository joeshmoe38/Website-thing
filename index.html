  	<h1>Race: Real or Not? </h1>
<h2> Race is socially and psychologically real.</h2>
<h3> Race is socially and psychologically real because according to the IAT the majority of people received test results saying they have racial bias. Although the majority of results are minor bias, the results show that a majority of people do see race as a thing even if biologically it isn’t. 

The Implicit Association Test (IAT) tests for reaction time based upon what you are sorting. It uses these results and the images or words you sort to determine if you have an implicit bias. It can do this about fat vs. thin, black vs. white, and many more subjects. Although it may not be fully scientific, it can be pretty reliable and most of its results say the same thing: people have bias (in this example racial bias). 

In the video about eye color we see that when exposed to segregation favoring someone, they are ok with it. Although we also saw that when someone is faced with segregation against them they oppose it almost instantly. In the video about eye color we also saw that the students (who previously seemed like nice people) quickly caught on to the eye color segregation and followed it even if they didn’t have to.
 </h3>
 <h3> This evidence shows how even if actively opposing some sort of bias, people always have a little bias towards something if exposed to bias. In the video where the teacher segregated kids based on eye color, the kids started genuinely believing in this eye color supremacy. The “brown-eyes” felt worse about themselves when they were made to, and felt better about themselves when not actively discriminated against. This shows how when the teacher started giving advantages to people based upon the color of their eyes, the people who received advantages felt better than those who didn’t. When the teacher started actively damaging the experience of the students with different colored eyes those students felt worse than the other students. We see this same thing with so many things. We see people with XBoxes and Playstations saying that one is better than the other, we see people who have differently colored skin saying one is better than the other and much more. It does not matter what you discriminate against as long as someone has it better than the other person.</h3>
